	The Box Model
</h1>
	<p>In this section we discussed about different things related to box model that how we can specify differnt sizes for the box the elements occupy and how we can use them. Then we also diccused that we should use boader sizing to be boader box. We also learned about a selector(*) also known as universal selector and what it does is it applies the property specidied in selector to all of the elements present in html. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Then we also learned about another property known as overflow what it does is if the content is not fitable in box specified it will let you scroll instead of letting it flow outside of the box.
	</p>
	<p> There is something else at play here as well. There are two types of margins commulative and collapsing. To put simply horizontal margins are commulatives and vertical margins are collapsing.</p>

	Background Property
</h2>
	<p> In this we learned about different background properties like background colour, image, weight etc. We can define them sperately like background colour, back weight etc or just write background and deine them like for colour write its hexadecimal value with #sign give space write next property and so on so fourth. </p>

	<h3>
	Positioning Elements
</h3>
	<p> In this we learned about floating elements and their properties. We can use that by using float left and float right but remember use boader box for boader sizing. </p>
	<p> There is also another very important property known as clear which is used as clear left, clear right or both. What clear does is it clears the elements present on the specified side of that element take example of clear left it will clear all the elements present on the left side side of that element. It is similar for others as well.</p>
