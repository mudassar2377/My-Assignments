<h2>
   Conflict Resolution 
</h2>
<ul>
	<div>The following are the main points:</div>
	<li> <p> It always follows the rule that "Bottom comes first incase of execution for styles". Take example that in head section you have defined that all p tags will have color red but down the line you have definied that some of p tags will be blue so now the colour of those tags will be blue instead of red. </li>
		<li>
			<p>Confilct Resolution also follows the rule of inhertance like if you declare that text size in body is 24px this property will be applied to all children of body meaning all tags inside body will have text size 24px</p>
		</li>
		<li><p> The conflicting styles also depend on specificity(score) </p></li>
		<li> <p> If you want to override these rules lets just say you want that style of that particular place and by rules that style wont be applied just add "!important" to it. But be warned use this very very carefully otherwise things could sideways realfast.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>
	Styling Text
</h3>
<ul><div> There are different methods for it.</div>
	<li> <p> We different properties like font size, font weight etc </p></li>
